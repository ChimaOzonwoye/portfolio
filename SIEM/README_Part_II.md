# SECT: A Vision for Democratized Security

To the esteemed reader, this is an informal letter to you. Please pardon the familiarity in this read. Also, if all this seems too boring, you can just glance through and pay a little more attention to the call to action section.

## Simply Put, What SECT Is

SECT is not just for small businesses. It is for everyone. SECT is for the everyday person. Since nothing is 100 percent certain, at least from this perspective, it is certain that 99 percent of people who use their phones or computers and know how to open their emails can definitely use SECT. It is that simple. They can upload plain text, pictures/screenshots, and audio.

## When Privacy Meets Reality

The initial approach considered using normal LLM APIs, but that would not only cost more but also defeat the privacy purpose. With an LLM fine-tuned and SECT using its API like it uses other APIs such as OCR, this would be feasible. Individuals have been successfully fine-tuning models they use locally. Also, this would be better than normal LLM APIs as it would be more security-focused and trained.

The version of SECT envisioned as truly enterprise-grade involves taking an open-source LLM and fine-tuning it into a security intelligence. Since they are free, the only cost would be hosting on a cloud platform. Or better still, use the DeepSeek approach and host it on a local computer with sufficient storage, with backups in different locations like a school. A college would not mind housing this when it only costs them space and minimal electricity. After hosting on a cloud platform and inputting its API into SECT, the analysis would improve significantly. Since it is privacy-first, SECT searches this database like a user asking ChatGPT for info, but SECT will not have prompt memory after giving results. Its only memory is its knowledge database.

## Where Machines Meet Humans

Also thinking of having vetted knowledgeable individuals participate. When the fine-tuned LLM is not too sure, these individuals connect with users for a chat where they can share their email if they want and get feedback. Most social engineering scams are not technically sophisticated, but they are effective because they are tailored to their specific targets. Someone might not fall for a romance scam, but someone desperate for affection might, and so on.

## Students, Professors, and Everyone Else

The student individuals do not need to be experts. As mentioned, these attacks are targeted and would not need much nuance to notice by someone who is not the intended target.

Here lies a unique opportunity. Students often seek the most efficient path and may be hesitant to volunteer without clear incentives. However, partnerships with colleges could solve two problems at once. SECT gets its human analysts, and institutions, where professors worry that students are handing assignments over to AI and losing critical thinking skills, can readjust their curricula.

Professors can introduce lab work with significant grade weight where students must verify real SECT queries. This provides students with assignments they cannot simply hand off to AI. If their assessment and resolution for the user are great, the user can grade their assistance, translating to course grades. The students get real-life experience, and the integrity of their coursework is preserved. Everyone wins.

## Beginning With What We Have

After much consideration, starting with a small parameter model seems ideal, as this would easily enable fine-tuning locally on a personal computer. If all goes well, this would be the first LLM model for SECT.

## Dreams, Reality, and Everything Between

When I was young, I said I wanted to make a positive impact on society. This is amusing, but SECT might be a step to achieving this grandiose idea. SECT is not just for small businesses, it is for everyone... the everyday person.

**Side note:** To be honest, I will not say I had all of this in mind earlier. This vision was not fully formed at the start. It evolved and improved while interacting with an LLM about a topic unrelated to this. Initially, using standard LLM APIs was the plan, but I realized that would go against the privacy requirement. The ideas of fine-tuning open-source LLMs and the student-partnership approach for human services actually clicked while I was having that conversation.

## What You Can Do About It (A Call to Action)

Readers are truly welcome and encouraged to take the initiative in making this a reality. It does not have to be a collaboration with any specific person. You could do this by yourself or with colleagues and friends. Other than the cliché of contributing to humanity, you have now contributed to building a next-generation security tool/platform.

Although SECT is free, you could commercialize the knowledge/skills gained from fine-tuning an LLM or building SECT. Or maybe you are already an expert, then this is just another fun project.

For non-technical individuals who cannot code, which is quite a contradiction but we will let it slide as you are likely reading this on GitHub and using this platform means you are technical enough. Maybe not just with the skills of fine-tuning or architecting software, but technical enough to understand the nuance, and that is truly fine. You can suggest this new model of students taking part to colleges or professors. Start little. It does not have to be a whole institution. Just a class, a student or two. You do not have to start big.
