# SECT - Security Intelligence Platform

**[View Live Demo](https://ChimaOzonwoye.github.io/portfolio/SIEM/)**

## Project Context: Market Gap Analysis & Prototyping

**Status:** Functional Prototype / Proof of Concept
**Role:** Systems Analysis & Product Vision

This project represents a systems analysis case study rather than a traditional software engineering release. The codebase serves as a functional prototype designed to validate requirements for a "democratized" security solution. It demonstrates how enterprise-grade risk assessment can be simplified for non-technical business owners, utilizing AI-assisted coding tools to rapidly visualize the product vision.

## Market Analysis & Problem Statement

Through analysis of the current cybersecurity landscape, a critical service gap was identified: approximately 80% of small organizations and individuals remain vulnerable to common threat vectors.

Existing Enterprise Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools present two significant barriers to entry for this demographic:
1. **Cost:** Enterprise licensing is prohibitively expensive for small businesses.
2. **Complexity:** Effective operation requires specialized technical expertise that target users do not possess.

## Product Vision

SECT (Security Empowerment through Cutting-edge Technology) was conceived to address this gap by defining the functional requirements for a security platform that balances sophisticated threat detection with accessibility.

The core vision is **Security Democratization**: ensuring that advanced threat intelligence, email security analysis, and behavioral monitoring are accessible to stakeholders regardless of their technical proficiency.

## Functional Requirements Validated

This prototype demonstrates the technical feasibility of the following core requirements defined during the analysis phase:

* **Privacy-First Architecture:** A strict requirement that all processing must occur client-side (within the browser) to alleviate privacy concerns regarding sensitive email data.
* **Accessible Threat Intelligence:** The system must aggregate and simplify real-time threat feeds without requiring user configuration.
* **Visual Risk Assessment:** Complex log data must be synthesized into a single, understandable "Visual Threat Score."
* **Automated Content Analysis:** The system must utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and logic engines to analyze email screenshots and text for phishing patterns without manual intervention.

## Prototype Limitations & Development Methodology

**Note on Codebase:**
This prototype was developed using AI-assisted programming tools to rapidly translate functional requirements into a working model. The focus of this repository is on the *product logic*, *user flow*, and *architectural validity* rather than optimized software engineering practices.

**Current Capabilities:**
* Browser-based execution (HTML5/JS).
* Functional OCR integration (Tesseract.js).
* Live visualization of dummy and live threat data.

**Future Roadmap:**
To move from this prototype to a production-ready solution, the system would require:
* Transition from a web application to a browser extension for seamless workflow integration.
* Expansion of the behavioral analysis dataset.
* Optimization of the client-side logic for performance on lower-end devices.

## License

SECT is Free Forever and is dedicated to the public interest.

**Permitted Use:**
* Educational study of the market analysis and system design.
* Modification for personal security use.

**Disclaimer:**
This is a prototype provided "as is" to demonstrate a product vision. The creators are not liable for security decisions made based on this tool.
